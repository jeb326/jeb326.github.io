<h2>Skills assessment:Reflection</h2>
<p>Reflection Essay</p>

<p>When looking at the types of skills I wanted to learn more in depth for this assignment, I felt working with audacity was the best option. The project flows really well with my extra curricular work with the WPTS radio station. While at the station I have worked on many podcasts usually just on the content side but this year I have started editing my own podcast. I usually don’t too much editing except for checking levels, changing the amplitude of the cutting off excess time on ends of podcast. I never had to worry about background noise and microphone quality because I had been working in pretty nice studio and with quality equipment. Many of these problems came up when working on the project. These problems gave me an appreciation 
</p>

<p>The first thing I looked to do was to get the subject material for my project set. I wanted to diversify my content from the day to day sports talk that I usually do because it doesn’t have the amount of shelf life that some podcasts like a serial have. I know when I listen to sports podcasts from a day earlier, I find myself getting halfway and turning it off. I kept with the sports theme and looked at the experience of going to big sporting events. I planned to have my brother and I recount some of the great sporting events we have been to and describe why it meant so much. We were going to look at the big events we have seen like the very recent NHL  Stadium Series game on March 4th between the Washington Capitals and the Toronto Maple Leafs that was played in Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. We had been going to this stadium to see since we were little kids to watch Navy football so it meant a lot to us. We planned to look at small games that meant a lot to us. We wanted to do this on the drive either to Annapolis or back to not cut into family time and to give it an authentic feel like the listener was just a buddy of ours that is in the car with us.
 </p>

<p>The next thing I did was look at audacity. I thought that it would be a lesser version of software that I had previously used like Pro Tools 11 and Hindenburg but I was pleasantly surprised. Audacity had many of the features I had used and by halfway through learning Audacity, I found that I preferred using audacity over the other softwares. The controls were very intuitive and easy to navigate. I didn’t look through all of the video early so that I had my audio content available when learning the extra functions in the audacity. 
</p>
<p>The part that gave me trouble was the recording. As we started a drive back to Maryland, we tried out the recording with the headphone with mics to try and record the podcast. The sound that we got had a good bit of background sound from both sounds inside and outside of the car. It also was distracting for the person driving so I quickly realized that this wasn’t going to work. I thought of having one person recording at the time but decide to delay it. I was able to record later some of the segments i wanted to use. When looking at the videos on editing and moving segments, I decided that cutting the podcast into segments is a way to helps me re-organize my thoughts, prevents me from rambling since I don’t have a co-star, and gives me more freedom when doing the edits. Usually when doing podcasts for WPTS, we record a large chunk and put it out after quick edits. 
</p>
<p>I found the recording very similar to my usual recording. I used a usb computer headset so that the quality would be better. Recording the podcasts was normal. Like when I normally record, I didn’t look at the audio recording while I was talking but did during my breaks. This helped me change small things like my volume. 
</p>
<p>The last thing that I have been doing is editing podcasts. I have flipped back and forth from the lynda videos and my audacity project. I am able to change different aspects correctly. I found that most of my time was spent on editing whether it was small things the order of the segments or more important like removing noises. It seemed a little tedious at first but campring the last edit with the original shows how much editing helps.
</p>
<p>	Looking back on this project, I found these skills very useful and I think they will be helpful after the class. I originally thought it was going hard to get to the 20 hour mark but it seemed to fly by. I found that the mistakes like trying to record in the car very valuable to realizing how much effort you need to put in to good audio production.
