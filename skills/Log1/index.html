<h2>Skills assessment: Log1 </h2>
<p>2/23 log skills</p>

<p>So far, I have had some time to watch some videos of how to organize a podcast. Usually the podcasts I have made don’t have much structure. We usually just talk about the main topics until we get to around the 45 minute mark. I do like the ability that the audio media gives that there isn’t a normal structure like an essay. I think adding a little structure will make podcast seem more profession. </p>

<p>The topic, which I didn’t have in my original post, is a pregame for the Washington Capitals and little memory lane trip for me and my brother for the best games we have seen live. The extra thing I want to do it is have the podcast go while we are driving back from Pittsburgh to Annapolis. If this seems to be too hard, we will just record it at a different time. </p>

<p>Log1: Have spent about 5 hours working on format,topics and material.</p>
