<h2>Work 2: Step Brothers</h2>
<p>In the work in progress 2, I wanted to expand on one of the class assignment we did a few weeks ago with photoshop. In my group assignment, we took the movie poster for the Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly comedy, Step Brothers. We used different effects like spotlighting, messing with the brightness, and using the font from the HBO series the Jinx to add to the creepy, scary look we want to add to the poster. The poster came out pretty creepy as only the faces and hands of the 2 characters were highlighted.</p>
<p>When looking at ways to add to this, I felt that the only ways were to do some advanced photoshop editing like adding a person into the person more seamlessly or to go into video. I drew inspiration from a video that went viral a few weeks ago in which someone took clips from Toy Story 3 and arranged them to fit the context of the Avengers Infinity War trailer with the audio from the original trailer. The new trailer fit the original one perfectly and made it really rewatchable. I wanted to do something similar with Step Brothers. I felt like adding a creepy tone was something that would work well with certain clips from the movie.</p>
<p>Like my experience with Audacity and html coding, I have had some basic knowledge of video editing when working on cutting game tape for hockey teams using software like imovie but have not done any complicated edits. I wanted to connect it with work in class even though we hadnâ€™t done a section on video editing. The software I choose to use is the Adobe Premiere Pro that is available on the university computers. The software has a similar look that as photoshop so I was expecting some of the same issues that plagued me with photoshop that made my work look less than professional.</p>
   
<p>The first thing I did was to plan the clip and find the sources that I wanted to use.  I wanted to keep the final trailer to about a minute and a half with the same suspense that some teaser trailers for horror movies have. I looked for high quality videos from scenes that have the ability to be change to creepy if taken out of context. I used movie clips off of youtube that have segments of the funniest scenes in the movie. I download a few of these clips and the trailer that Columbia Pictures put out. The next thing I looked for was horror movie templates. I found one example that I cut up and used  to frame my trailer. The last gathering thing I had to do was find some creepy audio that would fit the trailer. I choose to use a public domain creepy sound that was a constant throughout. This gave me more freedom than taking creepy music from a horror trailer that has the audio set to the scares in that trailer.</p>
<p>Now to the real meat of the project: the editing. Using the sequence map that I created, I started to roughly assemble the clips in order. There was a lot of trial and error in finding which order gives the right feel. I decide not to use as much of a fades like some action trailer may use. I felt the hard cuts gave an uncomfortable feeling that most horror trailers use. I kept all of the audio from each of the clips and applied an audio gain to each one, dropping it by around 10 decibels. The low volume added to the creep factor. Over the whole trailer, I put an eerie music track. The speech and eerie music combo-ed well. As I started to wrapped up the project, I wanted to put my own spin rather than only cutting and reassembling samples from movie. I looked at a creative way to add cool title and stumbled across a transparent style that looked very movie style. It took a little while but came out looking really cool. 
</p>
<p>Halfway through making my edits, I found that someone else had done the same thing as me and made a creepy edit of Step Brothers. It was nice to see how my final cut stacked up to someone who probably has a video editing background. Overall, this project gave me the same type of experience that I did with Audacity. I knew how to do some functions but working on a completely new project gave me a better understanding of  video editing and how much work goes into it.
