<h2>Final Portfolio</h2>
<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>When first looking at the revise as a whole, I first looked at the course itself. Even though the course has be segmented into the 3 main sections being a computer coding one working with html and css, a section on simple photo editing using Adobe Photoshop and the final one, an audio section using mainly audacity; There still was a progression throughout that we followed. The website was something that had constant feedback and editing while the audio file only got a little bit of outside comment. Normally I don’t do that much revision on many of my project due to imposed or self imposed deadlines. I find that a final edit usually has my focus on it with small suggestions from friends and co-workers. It also helps that most of my projects, live shows and podcasts, are serialized and can be improved submission to submission. So setting up my revision goals I looked at which elements I wanted to prioritize. I chose to focus on elements I had done worked with all semester: simple html and audio files. In my steps to revision, I wrote down some of the comments given to the websites and audio files  presented in class to structure changes. The most prominent one specifically has to be dealing with the audio file. In class, you (Matthew Lavin) told one group that their audio file should have a narrative connected with them and not to just have a combination of sounds. I took this to heart and edit my sound clip with this in mind. 
 </p>
<p>Now with my work in this digital media class, I didn’t focus too much on my audience. Sometimes I would focus my reflection essays to explain my process to the professor but the audience wasn’t as much of a thought. Most of my content like the Step Brothers poster change to a Jinx, creepy style was something that made me laugh. I had the simple mindset that if I (my biggest critic) thought it was good then a good portion of other people would enjoy it.  The one place I usually don’t carry this mindset is when I do my sports show. As a Pittsburgh station, I usually try and keep most of the air time open for either Pitt focused sports like Pitt basketball and football or popular sports like the NFL or NBA. I started doing this with our hockey podcast we put out each week. We try and cover the all NHL teams but segment time to talk about the nearby teams that play in the Metropolitan Division. When organizing based on the a projected audience, I find the best time is before recording. There are a lot of things you can do in the edit but too many cuts can affect the flow of the project. 
 </p>
<p>After looking at the preparation for revision and how audience has an effect before and after creating content, I went right into the revision for the portfolio. The items I chose to look at and retool were the my audio clip, my defunct company logo change, my podcast i created for the skill assignment, some small website additions, and my trailer for my spoof on the Will Ferrell comedy, Step Brothers. When choosing the projects, I chose the ones where I thought they could have a tangible increase. I felt that with the skill I had learned, editing assignments like my original poster wouldn’t show the skill that i had acquired during this class.
 </p>
  
<p>   During my revision, I started to work on the assignments I could change the most. The most available to be improved was the skill assignment. This was when I used audacity to record a podcast using cheaper recording devices like a 15 dollar pair of headphones. I realized the effect that the recording equipment had on the quality even with all the effects I tried to use. I decide to revise it by using one of my hockey podcasts. I used more of the organization skills learned from the Writer / Designer book to prepare for the podcast. This worked well for keep 4 different people on topic but didn’t interfere with the authenticity. Most of the work for the podcast was after recording. There were tools I learned from skills assignment like compression and other effects made a real impact in stopping the rigidness I usually see in my podcasts. Usually the other members of the station just tell you the number to punch in but understanding the tool let me fiddle with the settings to get a full sounding podcast. 
</p>
<p>Some of the simpler revisions have to be the logo and the website. With the logo I wanted to try some small changes. In the original entry, I had a very bare bones frame for the logo. After tooling with some complex effects I used the handy pen tool to trace the outline. With the website, I tried to keep the simplicity that I had. Like in my presentation I want my website to be the first stepping stone to my content. Many websites like soundcloud and the station’s website. 
 </p>
<p>For my last revisions, I wanted to change my trailer. This was the project that I was most proud of because of the freedom that the assignment allowed. I had planned to do a few things. One of the things I had to do because of the time was use cuts from a horror template preview for the transition between the scenes. I had watched a few video on overlaying text onto images but couldn’t find the right settings to get it to look better than the original inserts. Another thing I saw in comparables was they had more content since they had the whole movie available to them to edit the parts that work the best. In the end, none of my edits did anything to really change my trailer. I feel that having more time with lynda videos and some expert help that i could significantly change the video. 
 </p>

<p>This revision session was a nice conclusion to the course. I found that there was room for improvement on most of my project and that for some there was a bit of a learning curve. It was nice to go back through and do some cosmetic changes to assignment I have spent hours working on.

<h4>5 Revisions</h4>

<p>Question 1: sound,
In my initial sound, I had a military theme that used sounds of walkie talkies as communication with the sounds of a Middle Eastern city in the background. When other students presented their sounds in class, Professor Lavin commented that the sound should have a narrative to follow. I took this comment into my own sound. I changed the radio communication sound to one based in a military operation. I also added snipe fire and a humvee to the clip. I made the sound of the humvee slowly fade out to give the feeling of the humvee being the evacuation of the sniper unit. I took a lot of inspiration from the show “ Seal Team” in making the sound represent the genre of accurate military dramas. I hope that when a former or current military members can follow the clip and maybe give more feedback to the organization of the sound to make it seem more realistic. I think a good comparison would be adding audio to a scene from the show to see if it fits. 
 </p>
  
<p>Question 2: Logo.
 
When looking at the logo that I had made during class a few weeks ago, I wanted to complete the look and see what minor aesthetics like adding little splashes of color would have an impact of the type of message that the logo presents. I added the logo back into photoshop to complete the design. I struggle in finding a tool that gave me the look of an electrical cable with either the flexibility of the cord of the thickness. I found that the best way to change it was to use the simple pen tool. It gave me the feel I wanted. I decide that the red give a little bit of homage to the original that my subject, Circuit City had before going out of business. Other muted colors gave feel more like geek squad rather than a retailer like Best Buy. The font was changed slightly to give it a more technical look than the Big Lots type of design it had.

<p> Question 3: skills, 
For the skills assignment revision I looked at using some of the skills I had learned in my audacity project to my weekly hockey podcasts. Now we don’t use audacity to record the podcast but almost all of the features in audacity are in the software we use, Pro tools 11. When setting up for the podcast, I had a better understanding of the impact of setting the levels correctly. We kept our organization of our thoughts the same as we did before to give it a more free flowing feel.

<p>Question 4: website, 
For my website in total I kept it very simple. As I explained in my presentation I thought of the website as a vehicle for my other work at the moment. With github having some restrictions on the file size restrictions like file can’t be larger than 25 megabytes, it has been hard to fully commit to posting my work exclusively on my site.  It actually prevented me from posting a longer podcast onto my website for the revision of the skills blog. So far, most of my revision for my website have been to make the content more organized visually and drawing people to the links of my content.
</p>
  
<p>Question 5: video
The project I was most proud of from this semester’s class has to be the improvement on my poster into the short trailer of Step Brothers. The original poster used enhance the creepy elements of the movie poster from Step Brothers and gave it a creepy vibe. I felt like horror was the easiest transition to make since adding darkness and lowering sounds can change the tone. Unfortunately due to scheduling and other time commitments, i was not able to edit the clip. I do have a plan for what I would do if I had better access to Adobe Premiere. One of the things I didn't like from my initial project was I realized on basically placeholder text slides to move from segment to segment.
