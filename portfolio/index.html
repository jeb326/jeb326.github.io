<h2>5 Revisions</h2>

<p>Question 1: sound,
In my initial sound, I had a military theme that used sounds of walkie talkies as communication with the sounds of a Middle Eastern city in the background. When other students presented their sounds in class, Professor Lavin commented that the sound should have a narrative to follow. I took this comment into my own sound. I changed the radio communication sound to one based in a military operation. I also added snipe fire and a humvee to the clip. I made the sound of the humvee slowly fade out to give the feeling of the humvee being the evacuation of the sniper unit. I took a lot of inspiration from the show “ Seal Team” in making the sound represent the genre of accurate military dramas. I hope that when a former or current military members can follow the clip and maybe give more feedback to the organization of the sound to make it seem more realistic. I think a good comparison would be adding audio to a scene from the show to see if it fits.

<p>Question 2: Logo.
 
When looking at the logo that I had made during class a few weeks ago, I wanted to complete the look and see what minor aesthetics like adding little splashes of color would have an impact of the type of message that the logo presents. I added the logo back into photoshop to complete the design. I struggle in finding a tool that gave me the look of an electrical cable with either the flexibility of the cord of the thickness. I found that the best way to change it was to use the simple pen tool. It gave me the feel I wanted. I decide that the red give a little bit of homage to the original that my subject, Circuit City had before going out of business. Other muted colors gave feel more like geek squad rather than a retailer like Best Buy. The font was changed slightly to give it a more technical look than the Big Lots type of design it had.

<p> Question 3: skills, 
For the skills assignment revision I looked at using some of the skills I had learned in my audacity project to my weekly hockey podcasts. Now we don’t use audacity to record the podcast but almost all of the features in audacity are in the software we use, Pro tools 11. When setting up for the podcast, I had a better understanding of the impact of setting the levels correctly. We kept our organization of our thoughts the same as we did before to give it a more free flowing feel.

<p>Question 4: website, 
For my website in total I kept it very simple. As I explained in my presentation I thought of the website as a vehicle for my other work at the moment. With github having some restrictions on the file size restrictions like file can’t be larger than 25 megabytes, it has been hard to fully commit to posting my work exclusively on my site.  It actually prevented me from posting a longer podcast onto my website for the revision of the skills blog. So far, most of my revision for my website have been to make the content more organized visually and drawing people to the links of my content.

<p>Question 5: video
The project I was most proud of from this semester’s class has to be the improvement on my poster into the short trailer of Step Brothers. The original poster used enhance the creepy elements of the movie poster from Step Brothers and gave it a creepy vibe. I felt like horror was the easiest transition to make since adding darkness and lowering sounds can change the tone. Unfortunately due to scheduling and other time commitments, i was not able to edit the clip. I do have a plan for what I would do if I had better access to Adobe Premiere. One of the things I didn't like from my initial project was I realized on basically placeholder text slides to move from segment to segment.
