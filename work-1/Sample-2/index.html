<h2>Website Outlook</h2>
<p class="solid">When I am looking at creating my website, the first thing I am looking for is quick functional to my projects and resume. When looking at the navigation, I want certain parts to be highlighted: About me, resume, projects like podcasts and data work. I wantthem to be available from the home page and access the site mobily. I look at sites like a friend of mine has which can tell his story and experiences to prospective clients or employers. Aesthetically, I want it to be welcoming without feeling like I am throwing a textbook at the viewer. Sites like ESPN or other news site have a very content heavy feel. There are links to different stories on every part of the page. That works for a huge company but not for an individualâ€™s page.                                    
Audience: Prospective employers or colleagues and fans of work
Purpose: Project and Resume Promotion
Author: Data Scientist/ Radio guy 
Genre: Work and everyday life   </p>
