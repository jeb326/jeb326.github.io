<h2>Reflection Essay</h2>
<p>Going into this class, I was excited to learn the basics of html but was also a little worried. I never got into any type of programming until last year when I was using some software for my  advanced statistics classes. The program we used was R but I mainly used rstudio, a shell that better organizes the functions I was using. The way I had used r and the shell was way different than coding html on the first day. I was able to get some of the ideas but would easily lose track of overlapping tags like the body and paragraph tags. I had more difficulty than I had expected. The CSS video playlist off of the Lynda library were somewhat helpful in the beginning but seemed to be a little hard to follow. After a little bit of searching around the web for quick answer to the new code I wanted to add, I use sites with small tutorials on how to add new functions that make my website look a little more complex. The site w3schools has been instrumental in the trial and error process I have used rather than a text editor. This site helped a lot with the links I had to add to the site. I used a link button format that looks a lot better than the underline text that is the default. The only trouble I seemed to continous have was the location where the links were send me but some trial and error got me through that problem. My site has all of the basic functions but has a little bit of conflict with the styles that resulted in links being a weird color. Most of my edits have come in large chunks when I have free time. 
 </p>
<p> When thinking about what I wanted my site to look like, I had no clue. I didn’t want to make it like many of the sites that I visit. This is because the sites that I usually visit are very content loaded sites like espn and youtube. The organization of the site is usually to push the newest or most popular content at that moment. The view for my site is to feature some of the few projects I am able to work when I don’t have classes or work. I have mainly looked at free css templates and very simple sites as inspiration for my sites look and feel. The basic concepts we learned from the Writer/ Designer textbook I found to be good parameters when I am editing my site’s style. Currently, my organization of my site sits at the very basics with some “experimental” use of border around assignment text and a horizontal menu that makes it easy to navigate to all of the content that I have and have coming to my site.
</p>
<p>My desired look for my site later in the semester is that it has a simple look that is colorful and fun to visit. I have looked into using an already made free template and trying to reverse engineer it into one that fits my content the best. I used different free templates to narrow it down to my favorite one which is the Munter which can be found on the a free css website linked below. I found it to have a very professional feel while also being nice to look at. The template also finds a way to make a small amount of content look like a lot. I am hoping to use the skills I have learned so far to better fit the template for myself.
 </p>
<p>There are a few things that I definitely want to add to my site that currently is out of my skill level. The first thing I want to add is pictures to my website. I want there to be a visual presentation of what projects I have been done on my personal website. Another thing I would like to add but am not sure if it is feasible is audio files. I do a lot of work with podcasts with WPTS radio and would like like them to be available at very least as links if not natively on my site. The last thing I want to add would be bootstrapping. I find it to be a very smooth way to transition from each part of my website and a lot easier to navigate. These things seem to be achievable goals that can really benefit me inside and outside the classroom.
